History and evolution of Databses 

Brief timeline : 
-> 1950s - 1960s : Data was stored in flkat files and tree - like structure like punch cards and magnetic tapes
-> 1970s : Edgar F. Codd introduced relational databse model, combination of tables rows and columns
-> 1980s : Normalization was introduced to standardise data modelling concepts
-> 1990s : Distributed and Object oriented database 
-> 2000s - present : No SQL, Cloud database

Types of Databses 

1. RDBMS : Data stored in tables, rows and columns and keys for relationships Ex : MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL
   Advantages : Consistency, ACID, Structured data.
2. No-SQL : Flexible data models, which can store unstructured or semi-structured data Ex : Mongo DB, Cassandra
   Advantages : Flexible, scalable, and better for Un-structured data.

Database Overview : 
Software to interact with databases, ensuring storage, retrieval, manipulation and integration
Defintion -> CREATION
Manipulation -> CRUD
Security and Access controls
Query Optimisation

Key Differences between SQL VS No-SQL Databases :

-> SQL
1. Tabular data model
2. Fixed and Predefined schema
3. Good for structured data
4. ACID transaction
5. Vertical Scaling (Adding more power to single server)
   
-> No SQL
1. Flexible data model
2. Dynamic schema
3. Good for Large and Un-structured data
4. Horizontally scalable (adding more servers)
